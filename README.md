# Word Tokenization and Word Cloud Generation

This repository contains Python scripts for performing word tokenization and generating word clouds using the NLTK and WordCloud libraries. The scripts utilize a text file, specifically *JaneEyre.txt*, to demonstrate the functionalities.

## Features

- **Word Tokenization**: Breaks down the text into tokens (words) using the NLTK library.
- **Word Cloud Generation**: Creates visual representations of word frequency using the WordCloud library, with options for customization and the ability to use a mask for specific shapes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- WordCloud
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mubashir-Ansari/Word-Tokenization-word-cloud.git
   cd Word-Tokenization-word-cloud
